# SnapDesign

Welcome to SnapDesign! ⚡

SnapDesign is my experimental playground for advanced UI/UX ideas and creative web interactions.

## Highlights
- Creative navbars, menus, and page transitions
- Login and sign-up forms
- Experimental animations and interactive components
- Constantly evolving UI/UX experiments

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)
- JavaScript (light usage for demos)

## Notes
Each component or page is designed to explore new concepts and enhance front-end skills. More creative elements will be added over time.
