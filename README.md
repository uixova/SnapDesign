# SnapDesign

Welcome to SnapDesign! ⚡

SnapDesign is my experimental playground for advanced UI/UX ideas and creative web interactions. Here, I try new design trends, layouts, and animations to push my skills forward.

## Highlights
- Creative navbars, menus, and page transitions
- Login and sign-up forms
- Experimental animations and interactive components
- A constantly evolving collection of UI/UX experiments

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)
- JavaScript (light usage for demos)

## Notes
SnapDesign is meant to showcase innovation and experimentation. Each component or page is designed to explore new concepts and enhance my front-end abilities. More creative elements will be added over time.
